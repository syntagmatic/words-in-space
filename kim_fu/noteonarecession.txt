There is a diner—there are a million—
spooned against the highway, contoured as to a lover’s back,
with homemade ice cream and local Americana on the walls:
find all fifty states in the wordsearch on the placemat.
Waitresses in uniform toothy smiles crack bubble gum,
notably young or old, before and after a factory run of babies—
yes, they’re real. There is lightning
that is more than a camera flash, an almost-missed trick of the eye.
				White snakes that slither and nest, cross distances, grow vast.
				They reveal the shape of a pillarless cathedral
				with ample time for your slow-motor mind 
				to recognize grey and purple: long, long lightning.
				There are hanging lodge lights that flicker with thunder,
				windows streaked by rain—not a Hollywood effect,
				that rainmaking machine too forceful with its aim too straight,
				that trumped-up garden hose—
				wooden booths and stove-burnt coffee from
				kitchens stalled in the fifties. Cut green beans from a tin,
				Fanny’s fried chicken. Bugs in crevice refuge—
				sky declares war on earth!—or else drown 
				in puddles with the force of oceans,
				their world bombed desolate. Spiders survive on the eaves,
				swing wild in sideways torrent.
				A motorcycle hydroplanes slowly past the window
				with its wheels locked, as though on a moving walkway,
				—a mundane ride through the airport, a trick,
				raise the TV camera above their feet and the dancers float.
				There are men eating mash and talking of women
				in what is thought to be old-fashioned ways—
				though crudeness is the first language,
				propriety learned and unlearned along the way—
				in yeps and nopes and seldom more.  Waiting out the storm,
				waiting in diners, no question that the storm will end.

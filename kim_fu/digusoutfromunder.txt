Someday
we will give up on the past
stop scraping through layers
like birds making wallows to nest
someday we will stop looking
for talking objects
what was it like then?
stop believing objects cannot lie
that our interpretations
are less corrupt
than diarists and fabulists 
whose only surviving language
is gourd and sharpened stick
Will they find us fascinating?
peel layers of paint
off gas station bathrooms
make etchings of our switchblade carvings
chemical inversions of Sharpie ink
Will they find
our clich√©s and youthful calls for anarchy
sincere?
marvel at our rage
Will they retell our jokes?
like every culture
we worshiped the phallus
Will they find
what we wanted to preserve
what we hoped 
would last forever
A.L. plus M.F. will equal heart
until their huddled bones are dust
I was here!
I was here!
I was here!
